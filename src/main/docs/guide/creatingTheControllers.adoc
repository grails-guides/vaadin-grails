While completely unnecessary for Vaadin we want to demonstrate that there is no conflict
between Grails controllers and the Vaadin Framework.

[source,bash]
----
  $ grails create-controller vaadin.GarageController
----

Now letâ€™s edit our controller under grails-app/controllers/vaadin/.
We will import one of our services, update our index method, and add the following annotation.

- @GrailsCompileStatic - increases application performance


[source,groovy]
./grails-app/controllers/vaadin/GarageController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/vaadin/GarageController.groovy[]
----

<1> Declaring our service
<2> `index()` calls our service and renders the output as JSON

At this point lets make sure everything is working properly and run <<runningTheApp>>
the application.

Now we can exercise the API using cURL or another API tool.

Make a GET request to /garage to get a list of Vehicles:

[source,bash]
----
  $ curl -X "GET" "http://localhost:8080/garage"

    [{"id":1,"driver":{"id":1},"make":{"id":1},"model":{"id":1},"name":"Pickup"},
     {"id":2,"driver":{"id":1},"make":{"id":1},"model":{"id":2},"name":"Economy"},
     {"id":3,"driver":{"id":2},"make":{"id":2},"model":{"id":3},"name":"Minivan"}]
----

If data comes back everything is setup and connected properly at this point and we have
verified that we have some test data. Now lets look at how to attach Vaadin to Grails
