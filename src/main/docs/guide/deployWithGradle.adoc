At this point our application should be ready to deploy to Heroku proper. This can
be done with a few simple commands as follows from the top level project directory.

[source, bash]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit of Heroku app"
$ git push -u origin master
----

If it is successfull you should see the following in your terminal

At the end of the output it gives you the deployment url `https://still-hollows-47775.herokuapp.com/`
so you can go make sure your app started up properly.

NOTE: Once you have pushed you will need to wait about 30 seconds before your app will
display.

In addition to testing out your new apps deployment you can also view the status in your
Heroku dashboard. From the earlier screenshot where we verified your new application was
created, click on your applications name and it will bring you to the app dashboard.
