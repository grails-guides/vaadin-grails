Sometimes during deployment we can run into issues that are hard to track and we need to be
able to view logs. Heroku gives us several options to view logs based on your preferences.

The first is the trusty tail command, we can helpfully tail the Heroku logs directly from the command line

NOTE: Make sure your are in your project directory, otherwise it wont know which project to look at.

[source,bash]
----
$ heroku logs --tail
----

If living in the terminal isn't your thing, Heroku also makes it quite simple to view your
logs from their web interface. From your app dashboard click the More button on the upper
right hand side and select view logs.

Which will then display your apps runtime logs in Herokus web log viewer.
