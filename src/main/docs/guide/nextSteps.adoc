Thereâ€™s plenty of opportunities to expand the scope of this application. Here are a few ideas for
improvements you can make on your own:

- Create a modal dialog form to add new Drivers, Makes & Models. Use Vaadin's
https://vaadin.com/docs/-/part/framework/layout/layout-sub-window.html[Sub-Windows] to give you a head start.

- Add support for updates to existing Vehicles. A modal dialog might work well for this as well,
or perhaps an editable table row

- Currently Makes & Models are independent. Add an appropriate GORM association between Make &
Model, and change the select lists to only display Models for the currently select Make. You will
want to make use of the JavaScript Array.filter method.
