Now there are a few things we need to update in order for our application to run on Heroku.

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0,lines=9..14]
----
<1> In order to control which Spring Boot version we are using.

Next we need to add a plugin specifically for handling dependency management.
[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0,lines=17..19]
----

Followed by actually applying the plugin
[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0,lines=24..24]
----

After which we update our dependencies.
[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0,lines=44..86]
----
<1> Switch this to provided as Heroku supplies this for us.
<2> Add the webapp-runner which Heroku needs.
<3> Heroku also requires that we add postgres so add that as well.

Finally add the magic build glue that follows
[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0,lines=98..120]
----

The above is instructing Heroku's gradle on tasks to complete.
