Lastly a word on theming in Vaadin. Vaadin themes are located `src/main/webapp` directory and
are placed inside the `VAADIN/themes` directory.

WARNING: `VAADIN/themes` is a fixed location. If your theme files are not placed here they will not be
available.

If using our app or if you generated your own using the profile, the vaadin profile will create a new theme for you
called vaadin-grails-theme. You can see that we are using this theme in our `VaadinGrailsUI.groovy`

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/vaadin/vaadin/VaadinGrailsUI.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/vaadin/vaadin/VaadinGrailsUI.groovy[indent=0,lines="23..23"]

Vaadin themes are SASS based and have multiple ways in which they can be compiled. Since Vaadin themes
have more flexibility than standard css,
Vaadin themes require that a styles.scss exist in the theme folder as it is the glue that pulls
the different parts of the theme together.

[source, css]
./src/main/webapp/VAADIN/themes/vaadin-grails-theme/styles.scss
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/webapp/VAADIN/themes/vaadin-grails-theme/styles.scss[]
----

To add custom styles then we look to add them in `vaadin-grails-theme.scss`

[source,css]
./src/main/webapp/VAADIN/themes/vaadin-grails-theme/vaadin-grails-theme.scss
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/webapp/VAADIN/themes/vaadin-grails-theme/vaadin-grails-theme.scss[indent=0,lines="32..38"]
----

Add your rules under `Insert your own theme rules here`.
For more details on how Vaadin handles theming look https://vaadin.com/docs/-/part/framework/themes/themes-overview.html[here].
Vaadin gives a good overview of how they handle SASS compilation as well as how to build your
own themes.
