Next we want to test our new Heroku app locally and make sure that everything is functioning
properly before we push it out to Heroku proper. To test locally run the following two commands.

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew stage
$ heroku local web
----

If everything worked as planned your application will now be running at http://localhost:5000/[http://localhost:5000/].
Pending everything is running fine lets move on to fully deploying our application.
