At this point a test run is suggested just to make sure everything is functioning properly.

To run the application first

[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial/
----

To launch the application, run the following command.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

If everything is good to go this will start up the Grails application,
which will be running on `http://localhost:8080`

To see Vaadin in action navigate to `http://localhost:8080/vaadinUI` instead.
