Our last little bit of setup is to make sure we have our `.gitignore` setup to properly ignore
files we don't want to push to our heroku repository. If you do not already have a `.gitignore`
then from your top level project directory

[source, bash]
----
$ touch .gitignore
----

Now add files to ignore

[source, bash]
.gitignore
----
include::{sourceDir}/.gitignore[indent=0,lines=1..11]
----

Please pay special attention here as we ignore the `.gradle` directory but we want to make
sure we do not ignore our `gradle` directory as we need to make sure that gets committed
with our application.
