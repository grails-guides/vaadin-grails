First, lets start off with a bit about what Vaadin is. Vaadin is a Frontend Framework designed
to be a full replacement UI. It gives you the ability to develop your UI server-side in Java
(or in our case Grails) as well as still allowing more traditional front end development. For
our application we will be using the server-side developed components which give use the biggest
performance gains. Vaadin is also fully complimentary to the Grails framework. Vaadin does
not need to use Grails controllers and can connect directly to our service layer. This
leaves our controllers still fully functional with all the Grails goodness you have come to expect
for things such as REST API calls.

If you require additional information on Vaadin please check out the official documentation
https://vaadin.com/docs/-/part/framework/introduction/intro-overview.html[here]. Additionally
you may find a fair number of examples in an older version of Vaadin and
https://vaadin.com/framework/whatsnew[this] page gives a good explanation of how some of these
features have been updated in Vaadin 8.
