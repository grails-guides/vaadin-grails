To use `gradlew` with heroku you must also include the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` and
the associated `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`. So make sure that your project
has a `gradle` directory with a `wrapper` sub-directory and it contains the above files.

TIP: While not necessary for this guide if you need or want to change your gradle wrapper
version for the project, open your `gradle.properties` file and change the `gradleWrapperVersion`
 to the version you want to use. After you have updated the version, go to the top level
 directory of the project and execute the below command to update the wrapper.

[source, bash]
----
$ gradle wrapper
----
