Next create your heroku repository to add your code to.

NOTE: Your heroku urls will be different from what follows.

[source,bash]
----
$ heroku create
Creating app... done, â¬¢ still-hollows-47775
https://still-hollows-47775.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/still-hollows-47775.git
----

Once you have created your heroku app repository, go ahead and clone it to your local machine.

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://git.heroku.com/still-hollows-47775.git
----

Now that you have your heroku git hooked up, place your application files into the folder
that was just created from the `git clone`.

TIP: Copy everything that is in the complete folder (NOT the complete folder itself) and
paste it into you're new folder `still-hollows-47775`. (The build folder can be ommited from
the copy)

To view that your app was created successfully on Heroku just go view your dashboard and
there should be a new entry.
